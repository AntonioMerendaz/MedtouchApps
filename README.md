<h1 id="top">Medtouch Applications</h2>
These are the applications built and deployed during my work at [Medtouch](https://www.medtouch.com.br).  During these over 8 years, I've built over 10 apps for the [iOS Platform](#appios) and 5 for the [Android Platform](#appandroid) and the respective app updates for both platforms.
It is worth mentioning that most of the applications for the iOS platform were built in Objective-C, using all different types of tools and frameworks available at the time and the Android applications were done in HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery/Bootstrap and using cross-platform tools like Intel XDK, PhoneGap and Apache Cordova to wrap into native builds!
Another aspect to take into account is the "timing". Some features that with the current tools and frameworks are trivial to do, was done/built "manually" and I'll present this as it was at that time (innovative, difficult to accomplish).

### iOS:

<h2 id="appios">iOS Applications:</h3>

These applications were built using Objective-C and some were rebuilt with Swift.<br>I'll try to show the main features of each one and what can be done to improve them.
