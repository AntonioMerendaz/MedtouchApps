## Medtouch Applications

These are the applications built and deployed during my work at [Medtouch](https://www.medtouch.com.br)

### iOS Applications <img align="right" src="icons/Icon_CodeBlue_60.png"><b>Code Blue</b><br>iOS Applications

<strong>Obs:</strong> Most of these applications were built using Objective-C and some use Swift.  I'll try to show the main features of each one and what can be done to improve them.

### Features: 
1. Created a database in Firebase and connected to the app, with the names and images to be shown on the cards;

2. A ***Header/NavBar*** with three icons;

3. A body with a stack of cards, with the functionality of swipe right or left;

### Improvements:

1. Create the other functionalities/screens of the app;

2. Put each and every one button to work properly;

2. Authentication for the users in Firebase;

3. Adjust the database to contain all the data for each user, including his name, picture, name of other users chosen(or not) by him and the chat content;

4. Think of another type of database, if necessary, to keep all this data;

5. Improve the responsivenes of the app;
